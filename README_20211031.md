# Kickstarting with Excel

Kickstarter Module 1 Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client with data collected from previous plays funded through Kickstarter campaigns and to see how those campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

The first analysis involved comparing theater outcomes against their launch dates. The purpose of this analysis is to help inform the client of the best months in which to launch their play. Using a pivot chart, I gathered the total number of successful, failed and canceled theater projects and identify which month they launched in. The line chart below is a visual representation of this data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:

The final analysis required the use of the COUNTIFS() and SUM() functions to categorize the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays from the Kickstarter data.The SUM() function was useful for getting the total number of projects. Finally, I calculated the % total for each category by dividing the number successful, failed, or canceled by the total number of projects. This data was then displayed in a line chart allowing me to visualize the data and better communicate my findings to the client.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

 I did not encounter and problems with the Outcomes Based on Launch Date portion of the analysis but I can see how improperly filtering the data or failing to remove years from the rows filter of the pivot table can lead to inaccurate results. I did run into some issues with this analysis as I was unfamiliar with the COUNTIFS() function and repeatedly incorrectly input the proper code. I resolved these issues by reading into the function’s documentation and rewatching the module’s tutorial video on the function. After resolving these issues, I filled out the rest of the table, adjusting the code for each category and outcome. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

Based on the analysis of the theatre outcomes by launch date data, we can see that May and June are the best months to launch a theatre production. These months saw the launch of 111 and 100 successful theater campaigns respectively. We can also see that October and December are not great months to launch a theatre campaign. While these months did have a number of successful campaign launches, there also saw a very high number of failed campaigns. Based on this data I recommend the client aim to launch their fundraising campaign in either May or June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outcomes Based On Goals

Based on the data from the outcomes based on goals table and graph, we can see that the most successful campaigns had a goal of $4,999 or less. The second most successful bracket of campaigns had a fundraising goal between $35,000 and $44,999. Something to note is that the most successful campaign bracket based on percentage was those campaigns that had a goal of $50,000 or more. While this bracket has the highest percentage of successful campaigns, the sample size is rather small with only 12 campaigns existing in the dataset. Based on these findings, I recommend that the client set their campaign goal to either $4999 or somewhere between $35,000 and $44,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data is limited in multiple ways. The table for the outcomes based on goals does not display the data by sample size so we can not see which categories had the highest number of projects. This is important in ensuring the dataset has a significant sample size with which we can make decisions. Another limitation is that we have no other information to find out why certain campaigns failed and others didn’t. For example, why is it that December is such a bad month to launch a campaign?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Pie charts would have been great for the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis to show which funding categories had the largest sample sizes and see which were the most successful.
